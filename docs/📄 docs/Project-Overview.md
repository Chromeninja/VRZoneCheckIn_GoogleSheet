# Project Overview

The **VR Zone Group Check-In System** is a Google Sheets-based system that allows event organizers to efficiently manage check-ins and session tracking for virtual reality (VR) stations. Designed for both individual attendees and groups, the system streamlines the process of assigning VR spaces, managing game selections, and handling waitlists when stations are fully booked.

## üèÜ Goals

- **Efficient Check-In Process**: Provide a seamless flow for individual and group check-ins at VR stations.
- **Game and VR Space Assignment**: Automatically assign available VR spaces to attendees based on their game preferences.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Log check-in and check-out times, calculate session durations, and track VR space usage.
- **Waitlist Management**: Place attendees on a waitlist when no VR spaces are available and notify them when a space opens up.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Use Google Sheets for real-time reporting, with detailed data on VR space usage, player sessions, and more.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Group Check-In**: Allows a group of attendees to check in together, with each member assigned their own VR station and game.
- **Waitlist Support**: Automatically adds attendees to a waitlist if no spaces are available and assigns them once a station becomes free.
- **Customizable**: Event organizers can easily customize the list of games, VR spaces, and check-in workflows to suit their needs.
- **Automated Data Logging**: Logs all session details (check-in, check-out times, game selected, VR space used) in a Google Sheet for tracking and analytics.

## üîß How It Works

1. **Individual or Group Check-In**: Attendees can either check in individually or as part of a group. For groups, each member's name is verified, and each one is assigned to a VR station.
2. **Game Selection**: Attendees select a game from a predefined list, which can be customized by the event organizer.
3. **VR Space Assignment**: The system automatically finds and assigns available VR spaces based on the game selected by the attendee or group.
4. **Waitlist**: If no VR spaces are available, the system places attendees on a waitlist and assigns them a space when one opens up.
5. **Session Logging**: Check-in and check-out times, along with session duration, are logged in the Google Sheets backend for reporting and analysis.

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Gaming Conventions**: Manage long queues for VR demos and experiences by tracking and organizing attendees' VR play sessions.
- **Corporate Events**: Streamline check-in for corporate VR experiences, ensuring efficient use of VR stations.
- **VR Arcades**: Automate the process of assigning VR stations and managing sessions in VR arcades or gaming centers.
